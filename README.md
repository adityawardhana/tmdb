## Patterns

This project mostly used [Compund Pattern](https://www.patterns.dev/react/compound-pattern/) and [Container Pattern](https://www.patterns.dev/react/presentational-container-pattern)

### Why used this patterns?
- Separated business logic and components logic
- Used context for state management to make business logic
- Small/atomic components only accept properties, not to much logic inside components
- Standarized unit tests
- etc
